## ðŸŒ³ IOTA Identity Experience Team

The **IOTA Identity Experience Team** is a collaborative effort to provide help, guidance and spotlight to the IOTA Identity Community through offering feedback and introducing consistent workflows around [IOTA Identity](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs).

**IOTA Identity** is an implementation of decentralized digital identity, also known as Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), by the [IOTA Foundation](https://www.iota.org). It implements standards such as [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) from W3C as well as other related (proposed) standards.

**IOTA** is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to securely transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) amongst each other without any fees.

## ðŸŽ¯ Initiative Goals

The [IOTA Identity library](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs) is currently in alpha phase. Hence, we are focused on improving the experience around the following topics:

- ### Documentation
	Documentation goal includes everything related to writing, curating, and sharing content around with solid documentation at every launch, that is kept up-to-date, well-written explanations of tangible use cases to stimulate developer interest [Identity Documenation Poral](https://identity.docs.iota.org/) 

- ### Quality Assurance & Review
	Quality Assurance/Review goal includes making sure that the releases are easily usable, has no obvious bugs or pitfalls that might turn developers off from trying further once they run into them, make sure that the examples we provide are clear and work for the most common use cases the release is aimed at.

- ### Code Samples Development
	Code samples development goal includes Code examples and well-presented PoCs to kick start devs Create a list of RFPâ€™s for the EDF to fund Open-Source development

- ### Improvements to Module and Libraries
	Improvements to module/libraries goal includes Developer-friendly APIs at launch Solid comms both at release and after release (e.g. spotlight for community projects using each of libs)

- ### Testing Rust Code
	bla blub

- ### Testing and extending bindings to other programming languages (WASM, C, Python, Java, Go, ...)
	dfgsdfg

## ðŸ¤” How Can You Get Involved?

Show your interest by adding some information about you through an Application issue here on Github (see [closed issues](https://github.com/iota-community/X-Team_IOTA_Identity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)) and join the IOTA Identity Experience Team on the [IOTA Discord](https://discord.iota.org).

## ðŸ‘¥ What to expect?

Weekly meetups to discuss with IOTA Community as well as IOTA Foundation members to exchange ideas and give and receive feedback for the chosen goal(s) or ongoing projects.

This initiative is possible thanks to the contribution of the IOTA Community members and participants will be invited to participate in feedback collecting and evaluating sessions to further push the capabilities of the IOTA Experience Teams.
